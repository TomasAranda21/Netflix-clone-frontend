# Netflix Clone Frontend

## ðŸš€ About this proyect
HelloðŸ‘‹, I want to present you an application that I made with react, tailwind, nodejs and express. It's a clone of Netflix, the application is in Spanish, I regret having made it in Spanish, but that's how I started it and it was too late to change it to English.

The images and the name of the movies are taken from Netflix itself so that it has a little more "realism". I didn't like movie APIs so I decided to make my own API.
What could be added is a description of the movies, but I'll leave that for later with the possible improvements I make.



**The technologies used ðŸ› :**

 `React`
 `React router dom`
 `Tailwind`
 `React-player`
 `Formik`
 `Axios`
 `Font Awasome`


------ **The features it has are:** ------
-	Access
-	Check in
-	Recover password
-   The ability to log in without an account

----- **The functionalities that you have within the account are:** -----
- Being able to add movies to "My list"
- Create a profile like Netflix has
- Being able to add, edit the photo and name of your profile
- In your account you can change the email, and the password

## Possible bugs ðŸš«

The movie carousel is made with react and css. It has a logic that when the user clicks on the arrow it has a number of clicks depending on the size of the screen so that it cannot scroll infinitely. But by clicking too many times and fast this can cause errors in the carousel and the movies will not be displayed correctly and the web must be reloaded to be displayed correctly again. I leave you a small gif with the example. It's nothing serious, but it's something I need to fix.

## Possible fixes and improvements ðŸ”§ðŸ’¡:

- Improve the carousel so that it is tactile on mobile devices, for this we must take into account that the user cannot scroll infinitely.
- Add description to movies.
- Functionality can be added when choosing an account, such as premium, basic or standard and this is reflected in each user's profile.
- Add registration with Google for faster login.
- Refactor the css code, which is perhaps the most complicated to read.
- Add search functionality to each page since for now only the main page has it.
- Change the entire site to the English language.
